Analysis project focused on uncovering data-driven insights for client company Inovatech. Utilizes SQL, Excel, PowerBI and statistical analysis.

**Ovierview**

The goal of this analysis project is to discover data-driven insights for the client company Inovatech, a global e-commerce platform for consumer electronics. The analysis uncovers trends in sales, marketing effectiveness, product performance, customer behavior, and refund trends; providing a comprehensive view of Inovatech's performance across various areas of the business. Metrics and KPIs were tracked across multiple channels, and based on these insights, I provided recommendations on where Inovatech should focus its efforts to improve sales processes, marketing strategy, and operational efficiency.

The raw dataset contains approximately 225,000 rows and it provides customer and sales data.
